# 🎉 What's New - Roadmap Organization System

**Latest Update by Augment Code** 🎯

---

## ✨ New Features

### 🗂️ User Type & Event Phase Organization

Your roadmap now supports organizing features by:

1. **👥 User Type**
   - 👤 **End User** - Features for event attendees
   - ⚙️ **Creator/Admin** - Features for event organizers

2. **🎪 Event Phase**
   - 📅 **Before Event** - Planning & promotion features
   - 🎪 **At Event** - Live event features
   - 📊 **After Event** - Analytics & follow-up features

---

## 🎨 What You'll See

### Filter Panel

At the top of your roadmap, you'll now see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👥 User Type                  🎪 Event Phase            │
│ [All] [End User] [Admin]      [All] [Before] [At] [After] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Card Badges

Each feature card now shows:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Event Registration Flow      [High]  │
│ Allow users to register...           │
│ [👤 End User] [📅 Before]           │
│ #ui #backend #email                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Creating a New Feature

When you create a feature card, you'll now select:

1. **User Type** - Who is this feature for?
   - End users (attendees)?
   - Creators/admins (organizers)?

2. **Event Phase** - When is this feature used?
   - Before the event (planning)?
   - During the event (live)?
   - After the event (follow-up)?

### Filtering Your Roadmap

Click the filter buttons to focus on specific features:

**Example 1: View all end-user features**
- Click "👤 End User"
- See only attendee-facing features

**Example 2: View pre-event admin tasks**
- Click "⚙️ Creator/Admin"
- Click "📅 Before Event"
- See only pre-event admin features

**Example 3: View live event features**
- Click "🎪 At Event"
- See all features needed during the event

## 💡 Why This Matters

### Better Organization

**Before:**
- All features mixed together
- Hard to prioritize
- Unclear who features are for

**After:**
- Clear separation by audience
- Organized by timeline
- Easy to focus on what matters now

### Smarter Planning

**Build in the right order:**
1. Before Event features (need them first!)
2. At Event features (critical for launch)
3. After Event features (can build later)

**Focus on the right audience:**
1. End User features (drive attendance)
2. Admin features (internal tools)

### Better Collaboration

**With your team:**
- Frontend devs: Filter to End User
- Backend devs: Filter to Admin
- Everyone: Filter by current phase

**With stakeholders:**
- Show end-user features only
- Hide admin complexity
- Focus on value
