**Important Context Request:**

I'm working on The Ode Islands mixed reality show demo for Southbank. I need to know:

1. **Can you access our previous ChatGPT conversations about The Ode Islands?** We've had extensive discussions about the show, characters (Orns/Nors), narrative structure, and user experience design.

2. **What do you know about The Ode Islands project?** From what you can see in our current files and any chat history you can access.

3. **Current Show Structure**: Looking at our JSON files, you can see we have:
   - Chapter-based narrative (Before phase)
   - Story about Orns (happy beings) vs Nors (negative beings)
   - Video content with HLS streaming
   - User journey through emotional transformation

**For our Southbank demo, we want to showcase:**
- **Before**: The story journey users experience leading up to the show
- **Event**: Live mixed reality show experience companion
- **After**: Memory collection, digital keepsakes, community features

**Key Questions:**
1. What context do you have from our previous discussions?
2. What would make the most compelling Before/Event/After demo for The Ode Islands?
3. Should we focus on the emotional journey, the mixed reality tech, or the community aspects?
4. What demo features would best showcase the unique value of immersive storytelling?

Meanwhile, Claude is setting up programmatic sync between our AI collaboration systems.
