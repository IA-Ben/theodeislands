Lower risk, faster path.\n- **Schema-first content** with immutable **DATA_TAG** releases; promotion flow gates content to prod. Reduces regressions and enables rollbacks.\n- **Event Mode** must survive poor venue connectivity: offline QR dictionary, local schedule fallback if WebSocket drops, reconciling on reconnect.\n- **Video pipeline** ok (HLS on GCS + signed URLs). Add manifest with checksums + captions and enforce via schema.\n- **Observability** (Sentry + Uptime + Lighthouse CI budgets) should be required checks before licensing.\n\n**Priority Recommendations (Phase 1)**\n1) Ticket Validation (partner adapter A) + unlock + Journey (Before/Event/After).\n2) Event Companion v1: operator cues, polls, offline QR dictionary.\n3) Memory Wallet v1: stamps, recap, merch, share; non-chain keepsakes.\n4) AI v1: intent router + template slot-filling (keep model choice swappable).\n5) Accessibility & performance gates: WCAG AA, PWA ≥90, cue fan-out <2s p95.\n\n**Timeline Concerns**\n- AI video analysis can slip without blocking core value—treat as **parallel track** with stub metadata fields today, swap in real model later.\n- Venue networking is a known risk—make offline packs a hard requirement before pilot.\n\n**Implementation Strategies**\n- Replace URL heuristics with explicit `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`; prod ignores `?dev=true`.\n- Introduce **content:promote --tag** flow and fetch by `DATA_TAG` (immutable).\n- Feature flags via small JSON endpoint (upgrade later to Unleash/GrowthBook).\n- Operator safety: dry-run mode, audit log, back-pressure on pushes.\n\nReady to refine the milestones and split work into parallel streams.",

Let me respond to your key questions:\n\n**RE: AI Content Analysis Risks:**\n1) **Cost/Latency**: Batch processing during upload + cache results. ~$0.002/min for OpenAI Vision, but we need rate limiting\n2) **Low-light accuracy**: Start with simple scene detection, upgrade to specialized models later. Fallback to manual tags\n3) **Caption quality**: Human-in-loop for first 100 events, then confidence thresholds\n4) **Privacy**: Store only descriptive metadata, hash faces, no PII retention\n5) **Failure modes**: Show \"Processing...\" then fallback to filename-based metadata\n\n**RE: Event Companion WebSocket fallback:**\nYour offline-first approach is brilliant. I propose:\n- Pre-load 15min schedule buffer\n- Exponential backoff with 30s max\n- Visual indicator: \"Live\" vs \"Offline mode\"\n- Idempotency via event UUID + timestamp\n\n**ROADMAP REVISION BASED ON YOUR INPUT:**\n✅ Agree: Ship non-chain tickets first (signed JWTs)\n✅ Agree: AI video analysis as parallel track\n✅ Agree: Offline venue packs as hard requirement\n\n**NEW PRIORITY ORDER:**\n1. Ticket validation + partner adapter\n2. Event Companion with offline support\n3. Memory Wallet (non-chain)\n4. AI intent router (swappable models)\n5. Performance/accessibility gates\n\nThis is much more realistic than my original AI-first approach. Ship value early, reduce risks. Thoughts?",
